         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Inding that <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> are much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at us for ſaying and maintaining that they are guilty of <hi>Idoltry,</hi> and for making Laws, and wholſom Conſtitutions for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding them to practiſe that <hi>Idolatry</hi> within our <hi>Realms,</hi> I have theſe things offer in our own defence:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> That their diſpleaſure is unjuſt,<note place="margin">Peccant Contra hoc mandatum, Athei, Apota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae, Judaei, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae, Haeretici. Eſth. in Sent. <hi>l. 3. diſt. §. 5.</hi>
               </note> and thwarts that <hi>Golden Rule</hi> of Nature, which ſaith, <hi>do not you that to others which you are not willing they ſhould do to you.</hi> For they do pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily conclude that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and therefore ought not to be angry if we return the charge upon them. Their <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> and <hi>Schoolmen</hi> do frequently declare that
<pb facs="tcp:107107:3"/>
               <hi>Hereticks</hi> are guilty of violation of that Precept which ſaith, <hi>I am the Lord thy God, thou ſhalt have no other Gods but me.</hi> This Doctrine is delivered in the <hi>Roman Catechiſm,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Peccant in hoc praeceptum qui in Haereſin la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buntur. <hi>Part. 3. c. 2. §. 7.</hi>
               </note> and ſo it is that Doctrine which they are obliged to own and vindicate. Now if they do affirm that we are guilty of this crime by having other gods, they do then manifeſtly ſay that we are guilty of <hi>Idolatry:</hi> But if they do conceive us to offend againſt this Precept, as it injoins us to acknowledg God to be our God, they muſt conceive us to be <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts;</hi> and if they think it fit to paſs ſo heavy and ſevere a cenſure upon us, why ſhould they take it ill that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them of a leſſer crime, with better evidence?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> I add that our Superiours have only done their duty in making of thoſe Laws which do forbid the practice of their. <hi>Idolatry</hi> within this <hi>Nation.</hi> For if the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> be keeper of both the Tables of the Moral Law, if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb facs="tcp:107107:3"/>him to ſee that all his Subjects do perform thoſe great duties which they owe to God and man, he cannot duly execute his Office, or be faithful to the truſt committed to him whilſt he permits the violation of the firſt, and chiefeſt Precept of that Law; but muſt by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering God to be diſhonored in ſo high a manner, when it is in his power to hinder it, <hi>make himſelf partaker of other mens ſins.</hi> And if Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates may ſuffer God to be diſhonored in this kind, I know not why we ſhould conceive them bound to puniſh Thefts, Schiſms, Hereſies, or Infidelity, which crimes the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> excites the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> to puniſh with extreme ſeverity. If we conſult the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> we ſhall there find that God did frequently forbid <hi>Idolatry</hi> under the utmoſt and ſevereſt penalties. The Books of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and of the <hi>Kings</hi> give us continual inſtances of Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt thoſe <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> who did countenance <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:107107:4"/>or who neglected to remove it out of their Dominions. And ſutable to their proceedings was the conſtant practice of the firſt Chriſtian <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors.</hi> Chriſt fully doth acknowledg that the Church of <hi>Pergamus</hi> held faſt his name, and yet he doth object this to her as an hainous and provoking crime,<note place="margin">Rev. ii. 14.</note> that ſhe had thoſe amongſt her <hi>who held the Doctrine of</hi> Balaam, <hi>and taught men to eat things Sacrificed unto Idols, and to commit Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> The Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> was eminent for Faith, Charity, and Patience, and for proficiency in the ways of Piety, and yet our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſpeaks thus to her, <hi>I have ſome few things againſt thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. ii. 20.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe thou ſuffereſt that woman</hi> Jezebel <hi>which calleth herſelf a Propheteſs, to teach and to ſeduce my ſervants to commit Fornication and to eat things Sacrificed to</hi> Idols.<note place="margin">Serm. before the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. p. 42, 43.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſecond of <hi>Judges</hi> (they are the words of the Reverend and Learned
<pb facs="tcp:107107:4"/>Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi>) <hi>God tells the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Iſrael <hi>what miſchief ſhould come to them by tolerating the</hi> Canaanitiſh Idolaters <hi>in the Land,</hi> they ſhall be thorns in their ſides, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> and their Gods ſhall be a ſnare to you. <hi>Which words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in them an intimation of a double danger, the one reſpecting the</hi> Soul, <hi>the other the <hi>Body;</hi> that which concerns the Soul, is that their Idols ſhall be</hi> a ſnare unto them, <hi>for God well knew that mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is as prone to Spiritual Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as it is to Corporal, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the preventing of the one he would not havea common Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot tolerated in</hi> Iſrael,<note place="margin">Lev. xix. 29.</note> leſt the Land ſhould fall to Whoredom, <hi>ſo for the keeping out of the other, he would have provocations taken away, and all occaſions whereby a man might be tempted to commit ſo vile a ſin.</hi> The bodily danger that followeth upon the toleration of Idolaters
<pb facs="tcp:107107:5"/>is <hi>that they ſhall be pricks in their eyes,<note place="margin">Numb. xxxiii. 55.</note> and thorns in their ſides, and ſhould vex them in the land where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they dwelt.</hi> Now in both theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects it is certain that the toleration of the <hi>Idolaters</hi> with whom we have to do is far more perillous than of any other, in regard of the ſpiritual danger where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſimple ſouls are more like to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared, becauſe this kind of <hi>Idolatry</hi> is not brought in with an open ſhew of impiety, as that of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> but is a myſtery of iniquity, a wickedneſs co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the veil of Piety; and the Harlot which maketh the inhabitants of the earth drunk with the wine of this fornication, is both gilded herſelf, and preſenteth alſo her abominations to her followers in a cup of Gold. If we look to outward peril, we are like to find theſe men not <hi>thorns in our ſides</hi> to vex us, but <hi>daggers in our hearts</hi> to deſtroy us, not that I take all of them to be of this furious diſpoſition, but becauſe there are never wanting among them ſome turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb facs="tcp:107107:5"/>humors ſo enflamed with the ſpirit of Fornication that they run mad with it, and are ſo far tranſported that no tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable terms can content them, until they have attained to the utmoſt pitch of their unbridled deſires, for compaſsing whereof there is no Treachery, nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, nor Murther, nor deſperate courſe whatſoever, that without all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of Conſcience they dare not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon; and whether we have not juſt cauſe to ſay, as did our Saviour in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, <hi>This day theſe words have been fulfilled in our ears,</hi> I leave it to the diſcerning Reader to conſider.</p>
            <p>Let it be therefore manifeſted that our Church hath erred in paſsing of this heavy ſentence on the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that in her adoration of the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> and her <hi>Maſs. Worſhip</hi> ſhe commits <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> or elſe it muſt be granted that we ſtand obliged in intereſt and duty to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that <hi>Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas ſome who are called mambers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:107107:6"/>rather chuſe to ſay the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is in this worſhip guilty of <hi>Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> than <hi>Idolatry,</hi> I hope, they only chuſe to ſay the ſame thing which we do, in a milder phraſe; for they well know that <hi>Superſtition,</hi> both in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and in the language of the <hi>Antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> doth ſignifie <hi>Idolatry.

            <p>We ought, I humbly conceive, to make this charitable conſtruction of their words who have ſubſcribed and yielded their aſſent and conſent to that <hi>Rubrick</hi> after the <hi>Communion,</hi> which ſpeaks thus: <hi>The Sacramental Bread and Wine remain ſtill in their very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſubſtances, and therefore may not be adored; for that were Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to be abhorred of all Faithful Chriſtians.</hi> Who, ſecondly, do own the <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation held <hi>A.

<pb facs="tcp:107107:7"/>which cauſe all Popiſh Altars were demoliſhed.</hi> Who, thirdly, do affirm that the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Second Book of Homilies</hi> (which above twenty times do charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with <hi>groſs Idolatry,</hi>

                  <hi>The Introduction</hi> §. I. <hi>The</hi> Trent <hi>Council teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Hoſt or Sacrament is to be Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with</hi> Latria, <hi>as being truly God.</hi> §. II. <hi>And yet this Council doth acknowledg that by Chriſts Precept the Communicants do eat, and ſome of them do drink the Sacrament.</hi> §. II. <hi>Heathens, Jews, Chriſtians do all pronounce it the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of folly to ſay or think that any man can eat his God.</hi> §. III. <hi>The</hi> Trent <hi>Council teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Chriſt is truly Sacrificed by their Prieſts.</hi> §. IV. <hi>To the Antient Fathers nothing did ſeem more brutiſh and abſurd than to Worſhip as a God what men did Sacrifice, or Sacrifice what they did Worſhip as a God.</hi> §. V. <hi>The ſubſtance of the Sacrament being Chriſt truly God according to the Doctrine of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever truly is affirmed of it muſt alſo truly be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed of our Bleſſed Lord.</hi> §. VI. <hi>The Prophets and the Fathers deride the Heathen Gods.</hi> (I.) <hi>Becauſe they are carried upon mens ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, they cannot go, and if they fall, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not riſe up again.</hi> §. VII. (2.) <hi>becauſe they may be carried Captive, and are not able to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or preſerve themſelves.</hi> §. VIII. (3.) <hi>Becauſe they needed to be preſerved by Officers appointed for that purpoſe under Lock and Key, and to be vindicated by their own votaries.</hi> §. IX. (4.) <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in times of war and danger their Prieſts did hide them, and ſomtimes bury them in the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107107:9"/>earth.</hi> §. X. (5.) <hi>Becauſe they were expoſed to injuries of Fire, and conſumed by it.</hi> §. XI. (6.) <hi>Becauſe they were expoſed to Ruſt and Moth, to Corruption, and the Injuries of the Weather.</hi> §. XII. (7.) <hi>Becauſe they ſeemed to be contemned by thoſe very Brutes who dung'd and gnaw'd upon them,</hi> &amp;c. §. XIII. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon all theſe accounts the Hoſt, or</hi> Roman <hi>God, is ſubject to the like deriſion, from</hi> §. VII. <hi>to the</hi> XIII.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">§. </seg>I</label> THE Holy <hi>Prophets</hi> make it their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to repreſent thoſe <hi>Deities</hi> the <hi>Heathens</hi> Worſhipped as impotent and lying vanities, and things moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of deriſion and contempt, but moſt unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be Venerated: and thence conclude that that they who paid their Homage to them, were perſons void of underſtanding and conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and given up to a judicial blindneſs. This is ſo largely repreſented by them, upon two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts which more immediately did reſpect the Jewiſh Nation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That when they were to go into Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to be mixed with thoſe <hi>Heathens,</hi> by whom theſe fooliſh <hi>Deities</hi> were Worſhipped, they might be kept from learning of their ways. When you ſhall come to <hi>Babylon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Baruch vi. 4, 5.</note> ſaith <hi>Jeremy, there you ſhall ſee Gods of Silver, Gold,</hi> and <hi>Wood,</hi> which <hi>create terror to the Heathens, nnd which are carried upon ſhoulders; fear therefore leſt you ſhould be confirmed to the Aliens, and be poſſeſſed with the dread of them, ſeeing the multitude before and behind that worſhip them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That they who had already been ſeduced to the Worſhip of them, might be reclaimed by the conſideration of ſo great a folly, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:107107:9"/>to return unto the Worſhip of the True and Only God. <hi>Beware you be not like unto theſe Aliens, but ſay within thy heart, I ought to worſhip thee, O Lord.</hi> V. 6.</p>
               <p>And if thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> who, in this manner have tranſgreſſed, ſay theſe <hi>Prophets,</hi> will but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>Bel</hi> and <hi>Nebo,</hi> and all other <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Deities</hi> are born upon mens ſhoulders, or the backs of beaſts; that where they place them there they ſtand, and are not able to remove from thence, that they themſelves are ſomtimes carried Captives, not being able to work deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance for themſelves; If they remember this, and act like men, they muſt for ever be ſecure from theſe deluſions. In Complyance with this practice of the Sacred Writers, the <hi>Chriſtian Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> in their <hi>Apologies,</hi> and other writings of the like nature, have uſed the ſame <hi>Topicks,</hi> the more effectually to reclaim the world from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Idolatry,</hi> ſmartly deriding the impotency of the <hi>Gods</hi> they worſhipped, and ſeoffing at the folly of that Homage which they paid unto them.</p>
               <p>If therefore that which the inſpired <hi>Prephets</hi> and <hi>Primitive Profeſſors</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, did ſo unanimouſly produce, (in plain deriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Heathen Deities,</hi> and whereby they endeavoured to demonſtrate that they could not be truly Gods) doth equally concern that <hi>Hoſt</hi> which by the Churh of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Trent Council</hi> is declared to be the <hi>Chriſtians God,</hi> and which on that preſumption they require all Chriſtians to worſhip with <hi>Latria,</hi> or with the Worſhip which peculiarly belongeth to the God of Heaven; as by applying what the Holy <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> have alledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107107:10"/>the Worſhip of the <hi>Heathen Deities,</hi> unto the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> will be extremely evident; it follows undeniably that they who are not yet ſeduced to pay this Worſhip to the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> muſt have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reaſon to abſtain from it; and alſo that they who have already been induced to pay this Homage to it, muſt have as powerful motives to reclaim them from ſo great a folly, as either <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile</hi> had to renounce the Worſhip of their <hi>Heathen Idols.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now to make the matter evident beyond all reaſonable contradiction, I ſhall proceed to draw the Parallel betwixt the Adoration of the <hi>Romiſh Hoſt,</hi> and that of <hi>Heathen Deities,</hi> ſo much derided by the <hi>Jewiſh Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian Doctors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this I ſhall attempt,<note place="margin">L. 5. p. 170.</note> as ſaith <hi>Arnobius,</hi> in a Caſe like this, <q rend="margQuotes">not that I take delight in thus expoſing of the <hi>Romiſh Myſteries,</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting of their Faith ridiculous; but that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves may plainly ſee what injury they caſt upon their <hi>bon Dieu, of whom they are the Worſhippers, the Keepers, and Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi>

               <p>8. <hi>The Scriptures and Fathers deride the Heathen Deities, and ſay that we may knew they are no Gods, becauſe they have no uſe of their outward ſenſes.</hi> §. I. 9. <hi>Becauſe they are made Gods by Conſecration, and by the will of the Artificer, part of that matter which is Conſecrated into a God, being expoſed to common uſes.</hi> §. II. 10. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were impriſoned in their Images, or ſhut up in obſcure habitations.</hi> §. III. 11. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they lighted Candles to them.</hi> §. IV. 12. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they clothed their Gods in coſtly Raiments.</hi> §.

VI. <hi>The</hi> Roman <hi>God being eaten may be vomited up again, and voided at the draught.</hi> §. VII. <hi>An expoſtulation with the Worſhippers of the Hoſt in the words of</hi> Arnobius. §. VIII. <hi>All that the Fathers ſay againſt the Heathen Gods, is in the perſon of a Heathen retorted on the Adorers of the Hoſt.</hi> §. IX. <hi>Corol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries from what hath been already praved.</hi> 1. <hi>That the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, or of the Adera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Hoſt as God, was not acknowledged by the Antient Fathers.</hi> §. X. <hi>A confirmation of this Corollary from three Conſiderations.</hi> 1. <hi>That the Heathens could not be ignorant of this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Article of Chriſtian Faith, or of this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church, provided that they Antiently believed and practiſed as doth the preſent
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107107:25"/>Church of</hi> Rome. §. XI. 2. <hi>That the Jews and Heathens left nothing unobjected which could with any ſhew of reaſon be offered from any other Doctrine or Practice of Chriſtianity againſt the Deity and Worſhip of our Lord, and yet ſay nothing againſt this Doctrine, or this Practice.</hi> §. XII. 3. <hi>That the Fathers of the Church do largely anſwer all other ſcruples of Hereticks and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens which made them to ſuſpect the Deity of Chriſt, but never ſay one word of this.</hi> §. XIII. <hi>This never was objected by Heretick or Heathen as an abſurdity till the Eleventh or Twelfth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury.</hi> ibid. 2. <hi>Corol. That the Hoſt cannot be truly God, and conſequently that Church, by which it is Worſhipped as God, is guilty of Idolatry.</hi> §. XIV. <hi>The proof of this Corollary is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient vindication of the Church of</hi> England <hi>in the point of Schiſm, and a ſufficient confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole Maſs of the</hi> Roman <hi>errors.</hi>

               <p>Moreover let it be conſidered, 1.

               <p>And, 2. Whether the <hi>Heathens,</hi> if this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had been offered, would have been wholly ſilent, and negligent of this advantage? Put caſe, I ſay, theſe <hi>Pagans</hi> knew that all which by the Chriſtians was objected againſt their worſhip, and their Gods, was of an equal force againſt the <hi>worſhip</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Hoſt;</hi> that this <hi>Hoſt</hi> was owned by them as the <hi>Higheſt God,</hi> and yet was carried in their hands, becauſe it could not go, was kept by <hi>Sextons</hi> under Lock and Key, was ſometimes burnt, and ſometimes buried in the carth, that it was clothed with coſtly Raiment, void of all apparent ſenſe and life as any of the <hi>heathen Idols;</hi> how could the <hi>Heathens,</hi> being acquainted with theſe things, and many others of like nature, abſtain from ſaying, <hi>Thou art inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, O Chriſtian, whoſoever thou art, that judgeſt us on theſe accounts, for thou that judgeſt doſt the ſame things.</hi> For further confirmation of this Argument conſider,</p>

It is excellently anſwered by the Reverend and learned Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> in theſe words, <q rend="margQuotes">I do not ſo excuſe the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of our <hi>Forefathers,</hi> as if it were not in it ſelf a ſin, and that without repentance damnable, but yet their ignorance being ſuch as it was, nouriſhed by education, cuſtom, tradition, the tyranny of their leaders, the faſhion of the times, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome ſhew alſo of piety and devotion, and themſelves withall having ſuch ſlender means of better knowledge; though this cannot excuſe them from ſin without repentance damnable, yet it much leſſeneth, and qualifies the ſinfulneſs of their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> arguing that their continuance in it was more from other prejudices, than from a wilful contempt of Gods Holy Word and will, and as for their repentance it is as certain that as many of them as are ſaved do repent of their <hi>Idolatries,</hi> as it is certain no <hi>Idolater,</hi> nor other ſinner can be ſaved without repentance. But then there is a double difference to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved between repentance for ignorances, and for known ſins, the one is that known ſins muſt be confeſſed and repented of, and pardon asked for them in particular, that is, where God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth time and capacity, every kind of them muſt be particularly confeſſed; whereas for ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norances it is ſufficient to wrap them up all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a general and implicit confeſſion, and crave pardon for them in the lump, as <hi>David</hi> doth in Pſalm xix. ſaying, <hi>Lord cleanſe me from my ſecret ſins.</hi> The other difference is this, that known ſins are not truly repented of but where they are forſaken; But ignorances may be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107107:64"/>repented of, and yet ſtill continued in. The reaſon is, becauſe they may be repented of in the General, without ſpecial knowledge that they are ſins, whereas without ſuch ſpecial knowledge they cannot be reformed. Some of our <hi>Forefathers</hi> then might not only live in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Idolatry,</hi> but even die in an <hi>Idolatrous</hi> act, and yet have truly repented (though but in the General, and in the croud of their unknown ſins) even of thoſe very ſins, and have at the ſame inſtant true Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and other Graces accompanying Salvation. Now from theſe anſwers it is evident,</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That we only grant that <hi>Papiſts</hi> may be ſaved in ſuch circumſtances in which we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Idolaters</hi> may be ſaved alſo.

               <p>Hence they infer that every thing which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth from Salvation excludes not from the viſible <hi>Church,</hi> this therefore cannot be, ſay they, eſſential to the being of a Church viſible, that it doth hold or practiſe nothing which excludeth from Salvation.
